# Coding Challenges
This repo chronicles my journey to mastery through programming every day.

Here, I tackle a variety of coding and algorithmic challenges from various sources, including
CodeWars, HackerRank, and a variety of other books and sources all over the internet.

The solutions presented are by no means exhaustive, but in many attempts I try a variety of
solutions, checking for which ones are more efficient!
