# Coding Challenges
This repo chronicles my journey to mastery through programming every day.

The best habit I probably picked up during my time at HackReactor was the concept of "Toy Problems".
In continuing with that tradition of daily deliberate practice, 
I'm constantly sharpening the saw through coding every day, rain or shine (except my one Screen Free day on the weekends).

Here in this repo, I tackle a variety of coding and algorithmic challenges from various sources, including
CodeWars, LeetCode, HackerRank, and a variety of other books and sources all over the internet. While I'm
mainly focused on Javascript, I'm also tackling challenges in other languages
including Python.

The solutions presented are by no means exhaustive, but in many attempts I try a variety of
solutions, checking for which ones are more efficient!

If the challenge was from a particular source such as CodeWars, the challenge will be located
inside the respective folder. General challenges are located in the Misc folder.
